# odin-page

The main idea behind this project is just to get my hands dirty. As you can rightly infer, the webpage used html and pure css to replicate the design given.

During development, I applied css flexbox for most of the alignment of items on the page. I also learnt new things like: 
* application of the border-radius css property
* the use of view width/height in css
* how to make image placeholders, among others.

As of the time of building this project, I was not aware of the concept of semantic html, so I used divs for most of the parts of the webpage. I am now aware that the use of divs in this manner is not good, and I will update this webpage using semantic html.

This webpage is just a dummy showing how the items will be aligned and displayed. A proper site should also be expected in the next update.
